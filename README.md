The `.github` repo for GitHub organizations is special -- it's what public visitors see when they visit the [organization's profile](https://github.com/Sparks-and-Shadows).

This file is _not_ what is rendered there, however -- rather, it's the [`profile/README.md`](./profile/README.md) file.

Refer to [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile#adding-a-public-organization-profile-readme) on "special repos" for further information.
